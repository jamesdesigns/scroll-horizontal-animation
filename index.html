          <h1>01 David Carson: Break the rules</h1>
          <p>Appropriately dubbed ‘the Godfather of Grunge’, David Carson revolutionized the design industry by taking a unique, rule-breaking attitude toward design. His strikingly shredded, warped, and sometimes illegible layout designs remain to be a constant source of radical inspiration for designers around the globe.</p>

          <h1>03 Paula Scher: Treat Type as Visual Image</h1>
          <p>Paula Scher was the first woman to sit in a principal position at the acclaimed graphic design firm Pentagram, and for good reason. Her impressive body of design shaped the perception and application of graphic design in many ways, particularly her technique of treating type as a visual image in her work for the New York City’s Public Theater (pictured above) which continues to have a lasting impression on modern design.</p>

          <h1>05 Michael Bierut: Make complex content accessible</h1>
          <p>Michael Bierut is often credited with “democratizing design”, thanks to his unique and ubiquitous approach to graphic design. Bierut paved the way for ‘accessible’ design whereby complex content was made more easy and enticing to read and consume through a sharp, direct design.</p>

          <h1>06 Massimo Vignelli: Convey Ideas</h1>
          <p>Massimo Vignelli is considered by many as one of the most influential designers of the past century. A self-proclaimed ‘information architect’, Vignelli endeavored to condense large, busy ideas into more digestible, understandable formats through design. This is highly evident in his 1972 redesign of the New York City Subway Map whereby he chose an experimental, abstracted design that was heavily debated but later proved incredibly effective.</p>

          <h1>07 Milton Glaser: Bridge the gap between seeing and understanding</h1>
          <p>Creator of the iconic I ♥ NY branding, logos for Target and JetBlue, the opening title sequence to Mad Men, and poster designs for musician Bob Dylan, Milton Glaser has transformed what it means to create a powerful, timeless design. “You want to move the viewer in a perception so that when they first look at [the design],” Glaser explains, “They get the idea, because that act between seeing and understanding is critical.”</p>
